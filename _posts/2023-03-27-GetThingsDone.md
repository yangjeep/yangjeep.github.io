# TL;DR
In startup-style companies, finding the perfect balance between quick and dirty development and getting things done right may be a myth. Instead, making the right call based on each project’s unique circumstances is essential. By considering factors like urgency, complexity, customer impact, and resource availability, you can make informed decisions that suit each situation. Embracing flexibility, experimentation, clear communication, and reflection will empower teams to adapt and excel in the ever-changing tech landscape.

# True Story
When I first joined my current company, I was fresh out of the corporate world, where a myriad of processes, both good and bad, governed daily operations. As I transitioned to a more startup-style environment, I found myself hesitant to inquire about crucial aspects such as code commit criteria and coding standards. I worried that my background in a more structured setting would be at odds with the agile, fast-paced nature of my new team.

One day, I mustered up the courage to ask my CTO about these concerns. To my surprise, he looked puzzled and asked why I should be afraid. He reassured me, saying, “Hey, we hired you and we have confidence in you that you will help us formalize things without turning us into another Oracle. So don’t be afraid! We hired you because we need to get things done right now.”

That conversation was a turning point for me. It highlighted the importance of embracing the unique strengths each team member brings to the table, regardless of their background. It also reminded me that, in a startup-style company, it’s essential to strike a balance between getting things done quickly and ensuring quality. The CTO’s words encouraged me to contribute to the team by leveraging my experience without compromising the company’s nimble approach to development.

# Why
In the fast-paced world of technology, startup-style companies often face the challenge of balancing the need for rapid development with the desire for high-quality results. With constant pressure to deliver new features and stay ahead of the competition, it’s easy to succumb to the temptation of getting things done “quick and dirty.” But at what cost? In this article, we’ll explore the pros and cons of quick and dirty development versus getting things done right, and discuss whether finding the balance is feasible or if making different calls at different times is the key.

# The Quick and Dirty Approach
## Pros:
- Speed: Developing quickly allows companies to bring new products or features to market faster, potentially gaining a competitive edge.
- Adaptability: Rapid development enables teams to pivot and respond to changing market demands and customer feedback.
## Cons:
- Technical Debt: Cutting corners can lead to suboptimal code, resulting in maintenance nightmares and increased costs over time.
- Lower Quality: Rushed projects may be plagued by bugs, performance issues, or poor user experience, which can hurt the company’s reputation.

# Getting Things Done Right
## Pros:
- Longevity: Investing time in proper planning, design, and development ensures a more sustainable product with fewer issues in the long run.
- Customer Satisfaction: High-quality products result in better user experiences, leading to satisfied customers and brand loyalty.
## Cons:
- Slower Time-to-Market: Taking the time to perfect a product or feature can delay its release, giving competitors an opportunity to get ahead.
- Increased Upfront Costs: Spending more time on development may require additional resources, impacting short-term budgets.

# The Myth of Balance: Making the Call
Instead of trying to strike an elusive balance between quick and dirty development and getting things done right, consider making different calls based on the specific circumstances of each project. Here are some factors to consider when deciding which approach to take:

- Project Urgency: Is there a pressing deadline or a time-sensitive market opportunity? If so, a quicker development cycle may be necessary.
- Complexity: Is the project inherently complex, or does it involve critical infrastructure? If so, spending more time on getting it right can be advantageous.
- Customer Impact: Will the product or feature directly affect the end-user experience? If so, prioritize quality to maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty.
- Resource Availability: Do you have the necessary resources and talent to deliver a high-quality product in the desired timeframe? If not, consider adjusting your approach to match your team’s capabilities.

# Adapting to Different Situations
By recognizing that different situations call for different approaches, you can tailor your development strategy to suit each project’s unique needs. Here are some tips to help you adapt:
- Foster Flexibility: Encourage your team to be adaptable and embrace change, as different projects may require different development methodologies.
- Embrace Experimentation: Allow your team to try new approaches and learn from their successes and failures, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.
- Communicate Expectations: Clearly communicate your expectations for each project and ensure that your team understands the goals and priorities.
- Review and Reflect: Regularly review project outcomes and discuss lessons learned with your team, using this feedback to inform future decisions.

# Conclusion
While striking the perfect balance between quick and dirty development and getting things done right may be a myth, making the right call at the right time is essential for the success of any startup-style company. By considering factors such as project urgency, complexity, customer impact, and resource availability, you can make informed decisions that best suit each project’s unique circumstances. Embracing flexibility, experimentation, clear communication, and reflection will empower your team to adapt and excel in the ever-changing world of technology.
