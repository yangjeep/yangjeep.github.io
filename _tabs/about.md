Oh Hey! 

I'm yangjeep, and my friends call me JJ. 
I live in Ottawa Canada and currently working at Searchspring as Director of Engineering.

For work I care about the efficiency and happiness of developers: development productivity, quality of life and product, velocity etc. So talk to me about:

- Servant leadership
- Non-toxic management style
- Work-life balance
- Career development in both technical and management track
- Technologies in general:
    - Networking stuff (TCP/IP stack, IP network), as some of you may know I used work at Cisco for the longest time
    - Cloud Native computing: K8s, Docker, Serverless etc
    - Big Data (Learning!)
    - Elastic Search (Learning!)

When I'm not working, I do lots of things for fun, talk to me about: 

- Sports:
    - Soccer
    - Badminton
- Photography (gears, methodologies, works)
- Home-Labbing:
    - Raspberry Pi
    - Proxmox Virtual Environment
- Investments:
    - Real-estate investment in Canada (or in general)
    - Investment portfolio
